# Data Analysis with R and Tableau

Welcome to the Data Analysis with R and Tableau project! This project is aimed at showcasing my skills in data analysis and visualization using R programming language for data manipulation and preparation, and Tableau software for creating interactive visualizations.

## Overview

This project explores various datasets using data analysis techniques in R and visualizes the insights obtained through interactive dashboards created in Tableau. The analysis covers a range of topics, including exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and trend analysis, to derive meaningful insights and inform decision-making.

## Features

- **Data Preparation:** The datasets are cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis using R programming language, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploratory data analysis techniques are applied to gain an understanding of the dataset's structure, identify patterns, and uncover relationships between variables.
- **Statistical Modeling:** Statistical models are built and evaluated to analyze relationships within the data, predict future trends, or test hypotheses.
- **Interactive Visualization:** The insights derived from the analysis are visualized using interactive dashboards created in Tableau, allowing users to explore the data dynamically and gain deeper insights.

## Technologies Used

- **R Programming Language:** Utilized for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and modeling.
- **Tableau Software:** Employed for creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards and visualizations.
- **GitHub:** Used for version control and collaboration, hosting the project repository and documentation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. 
   git clone https://github.com/akshayak8/my-Tableau-Repository.git

3. Navigate to the directory containing the Datasets and Tableau workbooks.

4. Open the Tableau workbooks (.twb or .twbx files) in Tableau Desktop to explore the interactive dashboards and visualizations.
